# Create and Import Image

Tried to keep this script ultra simple. Its main goal is to create and import an image, and then verify that the import step worked correctly.

THe fun way to interact with this might be... if theres an error the import step can be run again? Can the chat report the error and offer to run this again.

## Info

- failing image source can be created by using this git repo to create a Dockerfile Image source type.
- success can just be any image from dockerhub
- source ids are found on source Settings tab
- API KEY is created under Hub > API Keys
